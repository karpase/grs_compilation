# grs_compilation
Compilation based approach to planning with distance goals

Requires use of PythonPDDL [https://github.com/karpase/pythonpddl]


Interface and file format based on GRS [https://github.com/apozanco/GRS_0.1]
Minor change: requires changing <HYPTOHESIS> in goal of problem file to (HYPOTHESIS) to avoid changing the parser
